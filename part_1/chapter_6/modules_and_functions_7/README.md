# Your Turn: ModulesAndFunctions-7

Find the library functions to do the following, and then use each in iex.
(If the *Elixir* or *Erlang* appears at the end of the challenge, then you'll
find the answer in that set of libraries.)

  - Convert a float to a string with two decimal digits. (Erlang)
  - Get the value of an operating-system environment variable. (Elixir)
  - Return the extension component of a file name (so return `.exs` if given
    "dave/test.exs"). (Elixir)
  - Return the process's current working directory. (Elixir)
  - Convert a string containing JSON into Elixir data structures. (Just find; don't install.)
  - Execute a command in your operating systems's shell.
