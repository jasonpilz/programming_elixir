# Your Turn: ModulesAndFunctions-1

I defined our `sum` function to carry a partial total as a second parameter so I
could illustrate how to use accumulators to build values. The `sum` function can
also be written without an accumulator. Can you do it?

## Implementation

```elixir
defmodule MyList do
  def sum([]),              do: 0
  def sum([ head | tail ]), do: head + sum(tail)
```
